In most casinos, if the vendor has an ace-king or better, he will peek to find out if he might want to improve his hand by taking another card. If your vendor doesn't have at least ace-king, he'll "stand pat" and not take any extra cards.

#  Get The Precise Details On Three Card Poker Hands 

3 Card Poker is one of the simplest casino games to understand and play. There are relatively few rules and these are easy to learn. Yet, there is a good deal of strategy involved in order to make the most of your chances of winning. The following guide will give you all the information you need on the different hands in 3 Card Poker so that you can come up with a winning strategy yourself.

The best possible hand in 3 Card Poker is a Royal Flush, made up of an Ace, King, Queen, Jack and Ten of the same suit. This hand is worth 250 times your bet. A Straight Flush, which is five consecutive cards of the same suit, is also a valuable hand and pays off at 50 times your bet. Four of a Kind pays off at 25 times your bet, while a Full House pays off at 6 times your bet. Finally, three of a kind pays off at 3 times your bet.

It’s important to remember that in 3 Card Poker you are not playing against the other players at the table, but against the dealer instead. This means that you should always aim to beat the dealer’s hand, rather than trying to beat the other players. The dealer will always have at least a pair (two cards of equal rank) so you need to beat this in order to win.

If you have two pairs or better then you should always raise – even if you think that the dealer has a better hand than you do. This is because there is a good chance that the dealer will bust (have a total score that exceeds 21). By raising you are forcing the dealer to either fold or risk going over 21 and losing automatically. If you only have two cards then it’s usually best to hold onto them and hope for something better on the next card.

For starters, in order to win a hand in Three Card Poker, you only need to create a pair or better. This means that even if your hand is relatively weak, you can still potentially win the pot if no one else has anything better. Secondly, unlike regular poker where ties are broken by suit order, in Three Card Poker ties are broken by highest card. This means that if two players have the same ranking hand (e.g. two pairs), the player with the highest ranked card will win the pot. Finally, some casinos offer a bonus payout for hands that rank as a Straight Flush or higher. So if you’re lucky enough to get one of these rare hands, be sure to ask your dealer what the bonus payout is!

#  What Kind Of Hand Do You Have In 3 Card Poker? 

In 3 card poker there are two types of hands- a pair and two different types of three card poker hands. The first, which is the most common, is a hand that has at least one pair. The second is a hand that has three different ranks, which can be anything from three of a kind to a straight flush.

The majority of people will have a pair in their hand, as this is the most common outcome in 3 card poker. In order to win with a pair, your cards must beat the dealers cards. If you have two hearts and the dealer has two clubs, you would win the hand. If you have two clubs and the dealer has two hearts, you would lose the hand.

In order to win with a three card poker hand, your hand must beat both of the dealers hands. This can be done by having three different ranks, or by having one rank and two pairs. For example, if you had three kings and the dealer had two tens and one ace, you would win the hand. If you had three eight’s and the dealer had two sixes and an ace, you would lose the hand. 

Knowing what kind of hand you have in 3 card poker is important in order to make the best decision possible. Whether you decide to fold or continue playing depends on whether or not your odds of winning are better than the amount of money you stand to lose if you do not win.

#  Find Out About The Different Types Of Hands In 3 Card Poker

In 3-card poker, you are dealt three cards face down. The aim of the game is to make the best possible poker hand using two of your cards and the dealer’s card. After all players have made their hands, the dealer flips over his or her third card to see what kind of hand he or she has.

The rank of hands in 3-card poker are as follows:

Pair 
Two pair 
Three of a kind 
Straight 
Flush 
Full house 
Four of a kind 
Straight flush 
Royal flush

In addition to the rank of hands, there are also different types of hands. These are: pairs, two pair, three of a kind, straight, flush, full house, four of a kind, straight flush and royal flush. In this article, we will take a look at each type of hand and what beats what.

Pairs: A pair is two cards of the same rank. Pairs can be beaten by two higher pairs, two identical ranks (e.g. two queens), or a three-of-a-kind. If two players have the same type of pair (e.g. both have two queens), then the player with the highest individual card wins. For example, if one player has Queens and tens while another player has Queens and Jacks, then the first player would win as they have the higher individual card (tens). If both players had Jacks as their pairs, then it would be a tie and no money would change hands.

 Two Pair: This is two different pairs or two cards of the same rank with one other random card thrown in). As with pairs, two higher pairs will beat out two lower pairs and if both players have twp identical pairs then the player with the highest individual card wins). For example if one player had 2 Aces & 2 Kings while another player had 2 Kings & 2 Queens, then the first player would win as they havehigher individual cards (Aces). If both players had 2 Kings as their Two Pair however, it would again be a tie.

 Three Of A Kind: This is exactly what it sounds like - three cards of the same rank. Three-of-a-kind can be beaten by either a higher ranking three-of-a-kind or four-of-a-kind; or by having a Straight or better (see below for more information on Straights). If both players have three identical ranks then whoever has the highest individual card wins i..e if both players have 3 sixes but one player has an Ace whereas another player has a 2 then the first player with Ace would win as they have higher individual card..

 Straight: This is five consecutive ranked cards regardless of suit). Straights can beaten by either foursomes (four cards all from one suit) or flushes (five non consecutive cards all from one suit). If both players have straights then holder highest ranked card within their respective straights will win e..g if one player has 10h 9d 8c 7s while another has Kd Qh 8d 7c then 10h will beat Kd Qh as it is higher ranked than King even though they are both within Straights)

Flush: This is five non consecutive ranked cards all from one suit) Flushes can be beaten by Straights (see Straight definition for more information) but cannot lose to any other type off hand such as pairs or threeof -a -kind etc) Full House: This is simply having three cards of one rank combined with tow other cards that share any rank between them (e g 6h 6d 4c 3s constitutes full house because you have 3 sixes plus any other ranks between 4 and ace inclusive ). Full houses can lose to foursomes but cannot lose to any other type off hand such as straights etc ) Four Of A Kind: As you might imagine this is pretty self explanatory - four cards offthe same rank . Foursomes can beat full houses but cannot beat any othertype off hand such as straights etc) Strait Flush: five consecutivecards all from one suit . Straits flushes can beat regular flushes butcannot beat any other type offhand such as full houses etc)Royal Flush: This is an unbeatable combination and consists oftenth Ace Jack Queen King .There are different variationsoff 3 -card poker that use different ranking systems for thesehands , butthe ones outlined aboveare those used in moststandard games .
