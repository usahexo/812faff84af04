#  How to Play Starbucks Bingo in Spain

If you’re looking for a fun, new way to spend your time in Spain, Starbucks Bingo is the perfect game for you! This easy-to-play game can be enjoyed by people of all ages, and it’s a great way to make new friends while enjoying some of your favorite drinks from Starbucks.

To play Starbucks Bingo, all you need is a bingo board and some tokens. The board can be downloaded for free online, or you can create your own board by drawing out a grid with 24 squares. You’ll also need to purchase some Starbucks tokens, which can be found at participating stores.

Players take turns selecting squares on the board, and if they match one of the items on their card, they mark that square off. The first player to completely fill their card wins!

There are many different variations of the game that can be played, so be sure to come up with your own rules before starting. Some ideas include using different drink sizes as spaces on the board, or allowing players to mark off squares for every item they order instead of just one.

No matter how you choose to play it, Starbucks Bingo is sure to provide hours of enjoyment for everyone involved. So why not give it a try next time you’re in Spain?
