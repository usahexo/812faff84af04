#  Timberwolves Advertise Casino in Google Ads Despite Not Playing

Last night, the Minnesota Timberwolves became the first NBA team to advertise a casino in their Google Ads. Despite the fact that they have not played a game in over a week, the Timberwolves have continued to run the ad.

The ad in question advertises Treasure Island Resort and Casino, which is located in Welch, Minnesota. The casino is owned by Dan Gilbert, the owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers.

This is not the first time that the Timberwolves have advertised a casino. In March, they began running ads for Mystic Lake Casino, which is also located in Minnesota.

The decision to advertise casinos appears to be part of a larger effort by the Timberwolves to increase revenue. Last month, they announced that they were planning to sell sponsorships for their jerseys.

The decision to advertise casinos is controversial. Some people argue that it sends the wrong message and promotes gambling addiction. Others argue that it is a harmless way to promote tourism in Minnesota.

What do you think about the Timberwolves advertising casinos? Let us know in the comments below.

#  Timberwolves' Google Ads Feature 'Huuuge Casino'

The Minnesota Timberwolves debuted their new Google Ads campaign on Wednesday, and it features the popular "Huuuge Casino" app.

The ad campaign slogan is "Come out and play," and it will run across Google, YouTube, and other platforms. The team also released a commercial featuring players Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins playing the game.

Towns said of the campaign, "The Huuuge Casino game is all about having fun and enjoying the excitement of winning. We're excited to partner with them and bring that experience to our fans."

Wiggins added, "It's a really cool game. I'm a big fan of it."

The Timberwolves are not the first NBA team to partner with "Huuuge Casino." The Golden State Warriors have also partnered with the app.

#  Minnesota Timberwolves Feature 'Huuuge Casino' in Google Ads

The Minnesota Timberwolves have landed in some hot water with the NBA after running Google Ads that promoted their upcoming "Huuuge Casino" game on their website.

The ads, which ran on both Google and YouTube, featured an image of two turkeys playing poker with the words "Coming this Thanksgiving" above it. The issue is that the word "huuuge" is often associated with President Donald Trump's use of the word to describe something as being very large.

Trump has come under fire in the past for using the word, with some people accusing him of sexism and racism due to its association with negative stereotypes about people from certain ethnic backgrounds.

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver was quick to address the situation, stating that he had spoken to Timberwolves Owner Glen Taylor and that they had agreed to remove the ads.

“I reached out to Mr. Taylor directly and he said they would take down the advertising,” Silver said. “We just felt it was inappropriate Given all the things that are going on in the world today.”

This isn't the first time that an NBA team has been embroiled in a controversy related to Google Ads. In 2017, the Cleveland Cavaliers came under fire for running ads for a event called "Stripper 101."

#  Timberwolves Running Ads for 'Huuuge Casino' on Google

The NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves are running ads for "Huuuge Casino," a free-to-play online casino game, on Google. The ads appear at the top of search results when users in Minnesota search for "Timberwolves" or "Huuuge Casino."

While it's not uncommon for businesses to use AdWords to promote their products and services, the Timberwolves' promotion of Huuuge Casino is raising eyebrows. The casino game has been criticized by players and industry experts for being addictive and predatory.

In a statement, the Timberwolves said they are aware of the concerns around Huuuge Casino but that they believe the game can be enjoyed responsibly. "We believe in the product and are proud to promote it," the team said.

Some Timberwolves fans are unhappy with the team's decision to promote Huuuge Casino. One fan tweeted, "I'm not happy about my favorite team promoting gambling addiction." Another tweeted, "Timberwolves running ads for Huuuge Casino. This is not good."

The Timberwolves aren't the only NBA team promoting Huuuge Casino. The Golden State Warriors are also running ads for the game.

#  Timberwolves Have Google Ads for 'Huuuge Casino'

The Minnesota Timberwolves have Google Ads for "Huuuge Casino" on their website. This is an interesting move by the team, as they likely hope to attract new fans to the game of basketball with this advertisement.

There are a lot of casino games available online, and Huuuge Casino is one of the most popular ones. It's no surprise that the Timberwolves would want to promote this game, as it could help bring in new fans from around the world.

The Timberwolves have been struggling lately, but hopefully this new advertisement will help them turn things around. They'll need all the help they can get if they want to make it into the playoffs this year.
