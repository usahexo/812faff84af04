#  Guardians Add Ace of Hearts for Strong Holdem Poker Hand

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 introduces a new Guardian - Ayesha, who has golden skin, and a high-pitched voice.

Ayesha is played by Elizabeth Debicki, who had a minor role in The Great Gatsby.

In one scene, she presents her newest creation to the other Guardians. It's an artificial being she calls "Adam".



Adam is played by Kurt Russell, who was last seen in The Hateful Eight.
In the comics, Adam Warlock is a character with godlike powers. It's possible that he may play a role in future Guardians movies.

The scene where Ayesha presents Adam to the Guardians is one of the most important scenes in the movie. It sets up the conflict between the Guardians and Ayesha that will carry over into future movies.

#  Cleveland Guardians Ace of Hearts Lead to Victorious Game

The Cleveland Guardians played the Chicago Bears on Saturday, and the Guardians came out on top with a final score of 41 to 34. The Guardians’ ace of hearts, quarterback DeShone Kizer, played an impressive game, throwing for 291 yards and two touchdowns.

The Guardian’s victory was not easy, however. The Bears kept the game close throughout, and the Guardians didn’t take the lead until the final minutes of the fourth quarter. With just over two minutes remaining in the game, Kizer connected with wide receiver Jordan Payton for a 27-yard touchdown pass, putting the Guardians up by 7 points.

The Bears attempted a last-minute comeback, but were unsuccessful. Kizer and the Guardians held on for the win.

This victory is a big one for the Cleveland Guardians. It improves their record to 2-1 and puts them in first place in their division. Next week, they will face off against another division rival, the Pittsburgh Steelers.

#  Holdem Poker Hand with Ace of Hearts a Certain Winner

In Texas Hold'em, any Ace is a strong starting hand. With an Ace of Hearts in particular, you can be almost certain of winning the hand if played correctly.

The first step is to ensure you do not get bullied out of the hand by opponents who bet aggressively. If there are several players in the pot and it's not the early stage of the game, then it's probably best to fold if someone goes all-in against you.

If you're playing against only one other player and they've only put in a small bet, then you may want to consider calling or even raising, especially if you have a good chance of improving your hand on the flop or turn.

Assuming you make it to the showdown, your Ace of Hearts is almost certainly going to be the best hand. Even if your opponent has a pair of Kings or Aces, they're still likely to lose to your Ace high. In fact, over 80% of all hands with an Ace will win when playing against another Ace.

This makes the Ace of Hearts a powerful weapon in any Hold'em player's arsenal - so make sure to use it wisely!
