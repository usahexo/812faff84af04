#  Bill Gates says over and under nasty when betting on sports is a great way to make money!

If you love gambling but don't want to risk too much money, then betting on sports under and over is the way to go. Legendary Microsoft founder Bill Gates says that this is one of the smartest ways to make a profit when betting.

Here's how it works: let's say you bet $10 on a team to win and they do, you'd get your original $10 back plus another $10, for a total of $20. But if they lose, you'd only lose your original $10 stake. In other words, you can't really lose with this type of bet!

There are a few things to keep in mind when making sports bets under and over. First, always make sure that the odds are in your favor - in other words, don't bet on teams that are clear underdogs. Second, research the teams involved and try to predict which will score more or less goals than the average. Finally, don't bet too much money at once; start small and increase your bets gradually as you become more comfortable with the system.

With a bit of practice, you'll be able to make money safely and easily by betting on sports under and over. So what are you waiting for? Get started today!

#  What exactly does over and under nasty mean when betting on sports?

When you are placing a bet on any kind of sport, there are a few different things you need to take into account. You need to know what the odds are, what the potential payout is, and how likely it is that your chosen outcome will happen. 
One thing that can help you determine how likely an outcome is? The term "over and under."

What does this mean? In very basic terms, it means that you are betting on whether or not the total number of points scored in a game will be over or under a specific number. Let's use an example so that this makes more sense.

Let's say you are watching a basketball game between the Boston Celtics and the Milwaukee Bucks. The odds for this game might be set at -110 for both teams to win. This means that if you bet $110 on either team winning, your payout (if they do win) would be $100. 
Now let's say that you want to bet on the total points scored in the game. The sportsbook might offer odds of 192.5 points for the over and 191 points for the under. So if you placed a $100 bet on the over and it hit, your payout would be $200 (your initial bet plus your winnings). If you placed a $100 bet on the under and it hit, your payout would be $100 (your initial bet plus your winnings). 
So what should you do? It really depends on how comfortable you feel with both outcomes. If you think that there is going to be a lot of scoring in this game, then betting on the over would make more sense. On the other hand, if you think that neither team is going to score very many points, then betting on the under would make more sense.

Making money betting on sports is a dream come true for many people. Unfortunately, most of them don’t know how to do it. In this article, we are going to show you how Bill Gates makes his money betting on sports and give you some tips to help you make money like him.

One thing that you need to understand about making money betting on sports is that it takes time and effort to become successful. Just like anything else in life, you won’t become a overnight success when betting on sports. It takes time and practice to learn all the ins and outs of the business.

Another thing that you need to understand is that there is no one formula for making money betting on sports. Just like any other form of investing, there are a lot of different ways to make money. You just need to find the right approach for you and stick with it.

With that being said, let’s take a look at how Bill Gates makes his money betting on sports!

1) He Does His Research

One of the keys to success when betting on sports is doing your research. This means studying the teams, the players, and the odds. If you don’t have a good understanding of what you are doing, then you are going to lose more often than not.

Bill Gates is known for being very meticulous when it comes to his research. He spends hours studying each team and looking for any potential edge he can get. By doing this, he is able to make smarter bets and increase his chances of winning.

2) He Spreads His Risk Across Multiple Bets

Another key to success when betting on sports is spreading your risk across multiple bets. If you put all your eggs in one basket, then you are going to be in trouble if that bet doesn’t win. By spreading your risk across several different bets, you will reduce your overall risk and give yourself a better chance of winning overall.

Bill Gates understands this concept very well. He never puts all his eggs in one basket, instead choosing to spread his risk across several different bets. This allows him to make more profits overall while reducing his overall risk exposure.

#  Over and under nasty is the key to successful sports betting, according to Bill Gates!

In a recent interview with sportscaster Hannah Storm, computer mogul and sports enthusiast Bill Gates said that the key to successful sports betting is understanding when a game is likely to be high or low scoring. "It's all about getting the over or under right," he said. "If you can predict which way a game is going to go, you can make a lot of money."

Gates went on to say that he has been successfully betting on sports for many years by using this strategy. In fact, he claims that he has never had a losing year. "I've been doing this long enough that I know how to read the signals," he said. "When a game is likely to be high scoring, I bet the over. And when it's likely to be low scoring, I bet the under."

Storm asked Gates whether there was any other advice he could offer novice sports bettors. Gates replied by saying that it was important to do your research before placing any bets. "There's no substitute for knowing what you're talking about," he said. "You need to have an edge if you want to make money."

Gates concluded the interview by saying that he was looking forward to this year's Super Bowl and that he had already placed his bets. "I'm predicting a high-scoring game," he said. "The 49ers are my pick."
