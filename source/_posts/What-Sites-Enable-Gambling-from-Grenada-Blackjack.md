It’s easy to see why blackjack is one of the most popular casino games – it has an element of skill and chance, and the potential for big payouts make it exciting to play. For players who are new to the game, there are a few basic things you need to know before you start playing.

The aim of the game is to beat the dealer by either getting 21 points on your first two cards (called a ‘blackjack’), or by scoring more points than the dealer without going over 21. Cards 2-10 are worth face value, while aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on what gives you the best hand. The king, queen and jack are all worth 10 points each.

To start playing, you need to place a bet. The minimum bet at most casinos is usually $5, but this can vary depending on the table. After you’ve placed your bet, the dealer will give each player two cards face up. You then have three options:

1) Hit – take another card from the deck in an attempt to get closer to 21.

2) Stand – stop taking cards and stick with what you’ve got.

3) Double Down – double your bet and receive just one more card from the dealer. This can only be done when your first two cards total 10 or 11.

After all players have made their decisions, the dealer will reveal their card and either hit or stand according to the rules of blackjack (which may be different at different casinos). If the dealer goes over 21, all players who haven’t busted win automatically. If both you and the dealer have busts, then whoever has the higher total wins (or if both totals are equal, it’s a push and your original bet is returned).

Blackjack is a fun game that can be enjoyed by players of all levels of experience. To improve your chances of winning, be sure to read up on the basic strategy for blackjack before playing.
