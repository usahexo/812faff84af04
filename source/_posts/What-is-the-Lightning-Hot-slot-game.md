#  What is the Lightning Hot slot game?

The Lightning Hot slot game is a classic fruit machine-style game that has been designed to appeal to all kinds of players. The game can be played for free or for real money, and it comes with some great bonus features that can help you to win big.

# The Basics of the Game

In the Lightning Hot slot game, you will find 5 reels and 20 paylines. You can place bets on any number of lines between 1 and 20, and you can also choose to play up to 10 coins per line. This means that the maximum bet in the game is 200 coins.

The symbols in the game include traditional fruit symbols such as cherries, lemons, oranges, plums and watermelons, as well as bars and stars. The top payout in the game is worth 2,000 coins, which means that you could potentially win a huge jackpot if you hit the right combination of symbols.

# Bonus Features

The bonus features in the Lightning Hot slot game are what make it so exciting to play. There are two different bonus rounds available – a free spins round and a gamble round. The free spins round is triggered when you land 3 or more scatter symbols anywhere on the reels, and it gives you 10 free spins during which all your wins are doubled. The gamble round is a simple guessing game where you have to choose whether a playing card will be red or black. If you guess correctly, your winnings will be doubled.
