# When to Hit and Stand in Blackjack

Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular casino game that is played all over the world. The objective of the game is to have a hand that is higher in value than the dealer's hand, but not exceed 21. One of the most important decisions in blackjack is knowing when to hit and when to stand. In this article, we will discuss the basic strategy for hitting and standing in blackjack.

## Hitting in Blackjack

When you hit in blackjack, you are asking the dealer for another card. You should hit when your hand is low in value and you need to increase its value to beat the dealer's hand. The basic strategy for hitting in blackjack is:

- If your hand is 8 or less, hit.
- If your hand is 9 and the dealer's up card is 3, 4, 5, or 6, hit.
- If your hand is 10 and the dealer's up card is 2 through 9, hit.
- If your hand is 11 and the dealer's up card is 2 through 10, hit.
- If your hand is 12 and the dealer's up card is 2, 3, 7, or higher, hit.
- If your hand is 13 through 16 and the dealer's up card is 7 or higher, hit.
- If your hand is 17 or higher, stand.

It is important to note that if you hit and your hand exceeds 21, you will bust and lose the game.

## Standing in Blackjack

When you stand in blackjack, you are choosing to not receive any more cards and stick with the hand you have. The basic strategy for standing in blackjack is:

- If your hand is 12 through 16 and the dealer's up card is 2 through 6, stand.
- If your hand is 17 or higher, stand.

It is important to note that if you stand and your hand is lower in value than the dealer's hand, you will lose the game.

## Conclusion

Knowing when to hit and when to stand is crucial to winning at blackjack. The basic strategy for hitting and standing in blackjack is based on mathematical probability and can help you make the right decision at the table. However, keep in mind that blackjack is a game of chance and no strategy can guarantee a win.
