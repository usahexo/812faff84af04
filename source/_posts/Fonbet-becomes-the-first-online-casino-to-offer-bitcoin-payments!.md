Bitcoin is a digital currency that was created in 2009 by a pseudonymous developer named Satoshi Nakamoto. It is a decentralized currency that is not subject to government or financial institution control.

In addition, bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, meaning that they cannot be traced back to the user’s identity.

Bitcoin payments are processed by the network of miners, who are rewarded in bitcoin for their work. This means that there are no intermediaries like banks or payment processors involved in the transaction, which reduces processing times and fees. 

#3) Access to global markets

Since bitcoin is a global currency, it can be used to pay for goods and services all over the world. This makes it a great option for online gamers who reside in countries with limited payment options.
