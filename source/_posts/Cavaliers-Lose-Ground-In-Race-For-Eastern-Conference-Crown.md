#  Cavaliers Lose Ground In Race For Eastern Conference Crown

The Cleveland Cavaliers (38-24) lost to the Milwaukee Bucks (30-28) on Saturday night, 120-116. This is the second loss in a row for the Cavaliers, who have now lost six of their last ten games. The Cavaliers are fourth in the Eastern Conference standings, and they are now four games behind the first place Boston Celtics.

The Cavaliers have been dealing with some injury issues lately. George Hill has been out since early January with a left shoulder injury, and Rodney Hood has been out since late February with a right ankle injury. Hood is expected to return to action this week, but Hill is still out indefinitely.

The Cavaliers also lost Tristan Thompson on Saturday night. Thompson was ejected in the third quarter after getting into a shoving match with Milwaukee's Greg Monroe. Thompson will likely receive a suspension for his actions.

The Cavaliers were led by LeBron James on Saturday night. James had 35 points, nine rebounds, and six assists. Kevin Love added 23 points and 10 rebounds, and JR Smith had 18 points off the bench.

Milwaukee was led by Giannis Antetokounmpo, who had 28 points, 12 rebounds, and eight assists. Khris Middleton added 26 points, Eric Bledsoe had 22 points, and Malcolm Brogdon scored 21 points off the bench.

The Cavaliers will next face the Miami Heat on Tuesday night.

#  Timberwolves Surge Past Jazz To Claim Northwest Division Title

The Minnesota Timberwolves surged past the Utah Jazz to clinch the Northwest Division title.

Karl-Anthony Towns was dominant throughout the game, scoring 25 points and grabbing 10 rebounds. Jimmy Butler added 21 points, while Andrew Wiggins chipped in with 18 points.

The Timberwolves held a slim lead at halftime, but they pulled away in the second half to secure the victory.

It was a great team effort from the Timberwolves, and they will look to carry that momentum into the playoffs.

#  Westbrook's Historic Season Comes To An End As Rockets Advance

Houston Rockets 105-99 Oklahoma City Thunder

The Houston Rockets are moving on in the playoffs after eliminating the Oklahoma City Thunder with a 105-99 victory. This was a historic season for Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook, who averaged a triple double for the entire season. However, his impressive season came to an end on Tuesday night.

Westbrook finished with 26 points, 10 assists, and 5 rebounds in the loss. He shot just 9-of-27 from the field and committed 5 turnovers. James Harden led the Rockets with 34 points, 7 assists, and 6 rebounds.

This was a physical game with both teams playing hard defensively. The Thunder led by as many as 13 points in the first half, but the Rockets made a run late in the second quarter to take a 54-52 lead into halftime.

Houston took control of the game in the third quarter, outscoring Oklahoma City 28-17 to take an 82-69 lead into the fourth quarter. The Thunder made a late rally, but it wasn't enough as Houston held on for the victory.

The Rockets will now face either Golden State or San Antonio in the next round of the playoffs.

#  Warriors Win Third Straight NBA Championship

The Golden State Warriors are NBA champions for the third consecutive season. They defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 108-85 in game four of the NBA Finals. The Cavaliers had no answer for the Warriorsâ€™ offense, which was firing on all cylinders.

Steph Curry led the way for the Warriors with 37 points. He was aided by Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant, who both chipped in with 20 points. The Warriors shot 54 percent from the field and 41 percent from three-point range.

LeBron James led the Cavaliers with 23 points. He was the only Cleveland player to score in double figures. The Cavaliers shot just 38 percent from the field and 21 percent from three-point range.

This is the third consecutive championship for the Warriors, and they seem poised to make it four in a row next season.

#  LeBron James Leads Lakers To Conference Finals

In his first season with the Lakers, LeBron James has taken them to the conference finals.

Entering the playoffs as the fourth seed in the Western Conference, the Lakers were seen as underdogs against the top-seeded Golden State Warriors.

But James led the Lakers to a four-game sweep of the Warriors, including a dominant performance in game four where he scored 33 points and grabbed 11 rebounds.

The next challenge for James and the Lakers will be defeating the Portland Trail Blazers in the conference finals.

James is averaging 27 points, 8 rebounds and 8 assists per game in the playoffs, and looks poised to lead the Lakers to their first NBA championship since 2010.
