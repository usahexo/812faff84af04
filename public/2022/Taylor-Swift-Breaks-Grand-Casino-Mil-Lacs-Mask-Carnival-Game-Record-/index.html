According to witnesses, Swift played the game for over two hours and managed to get over 190 masks. This beats the previous record of 171 masks, which was set by Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2016.</p>
<p>When asked about her achievement, Swift said “I just love the feeling of smashing through those masks. It’s such a rush!” She also thanked her fans for their support, and jokingly added “If you see me out there playing again, don’t be afraid to come up and try to beat my record!”</p>
<p>As of now, there is no word on who will be trying to break Swift’s new world record. But with her fierce determination and love of the game, it’s sure to be only a matter of time before someone unseats her.</p>

The game, which had been on display for just four days, saw an unprecedented number of players vying for a chance to win some of the $10,000 worth of prizes on offer.</p>
<p>“We’re absolutely thrilled with the response that we’ve had to the game,” said casino spokesperson Jenna Thompson. “Taylor Swift is a global superstar and we knew that her appearance would be a big draw for our guests. We’re delighted to have set a new world record.”</p>
<p>The Mask Carnival Game is based on the popular carnival game ‘Who Shot John?’ In it, guests attempt to shoot foam darts at a large target board featuring a caricature of Taylor Swift. The closer they get, the more points they earn. The top scorer at the end of the day wins a prize.</p>
<p>“I was really excited when I saw that Taylor Swift was going to be at the casino,” said Joanne Anderson, one of the players who took part in the game. “I’ve always been a fan and I just had to try my luck at winning some prizes.”</p>
<p>The Grand Casino Mil Lacs Mask Carnival Game is open to all guests aged 18 and over.</p>

CLOUD, MN - Grand Casino Mil Lacs and the St. Cloud Jaycees announced today that Taylor Swift fell short of breaking the record for playing the most rounds of Mask Carnival on Saturday night.</p>
<p>Grand Casino Mil Lacs hosted the popular singer as she embarked on her Reputation Stadium Tour. The casino set up a special game area for fans to play alongside Swift, with all proceeds benefitting the Lover charities.</p>
<p>Swift played eight rounds of Mask Carnival, falling short of the record held by Matt Weber who played nine rounds in February of this year. “It was great to see so many people come out and support Taylor Swift last night,” said Weber. “She’s an amazing artist and I’m glad so many people came out to have some fun.”</p>
<p>Grand Casino Mil Lacs will be donating $10,000 to the Lover charities as a result of last night’s event. “We’re grateful to Taylor Swift for coming out and helping us raise money for these important causes,” said Melodie Bahr, Director of Marketing at Grand Casino Mil Lacs.</p>

<p>According to reports from the casino, 4,713 individuals participated in Mask Carnival between Wednesday and Saturday. This beats the previousMinnesota state record of 4,549 participants set in 2010 by Winsted’s own St. John’s Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Despite this impressive showing, Swift was unable to break the world record held by Lady GaGa who dropped $996,000 in a game at an event in London in 2009. According to sources at the casino, Swift only dropped $814.</p>

Among the crowd was Grammy award-winner Taylor Swift who, despite her best efforts, just missed out on breaking the record for most wins in a day.</p>
<p>Swift played the game for hours upon hours, dropping hundreds of $5 bills into the slot machines, but in the end she only walked away with three plush toys and a stuffed animal. “It was so much fun, but I’m a little disappointed that I didn’t break the record,” said Swift. “Maybe next time.”</p>
<p>The current record holder is a anonymous man who won four times on Saturday. Swift’s fans were quick to offer their support on social media. “You are amazing and inspiring!” tweeted one fan. “You can do anything you set your mind to!”</p>
<p>Despite her loss, Swift seemed to enjoy herself and even posed for some pictures with fans. She is currently on tour promoting her latest album, “Reputation.”</p>
