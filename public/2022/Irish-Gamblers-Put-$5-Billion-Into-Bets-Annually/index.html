        <h1 id="Irish-Gamblers-Put-5-Billion-Into-Bets-Annually"><a href="#Irish-Gamblers-Put-5-Billion-Into-Bets-Annually" class="headerlink" title="Irish Gamblers Put $5 Billion Into Bets Annually"></a>Irish Gamblers Put $5 Billion Into Bets Annually</h1><p>Irish gamblers put nearly 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) a year into bets, most of it going to bookies in the form of illegal wagers, an industry study showed on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The amount gambled each year is equivalent to almost a quarter of Ireland’s gross domestic product and is more than twice the amount staked on legal horseracing, said the study by research firm Amárach Consulting for the horse-racing industry.</p>
<p>Around 85 percent of the gambling is illegal, with punters using bookmakers who often have offshore operations, said Amárach Consulting director David Farrell.</p>
<p>“There’s a very large black market for gambling in Ireland,” Farrell told a news conference.</p>
<p>The Irish betting market is dominated by four major firms – Paddy Power, Ladbrokes, William Hill and Betfair – which have a combined share of around 90 percent, Farrell said.</p>
<p>The government has been trying to clamp down on illegal gambling for years but with little success. In 2013 it set up the Gaming and Lotteries Commission to regulate the industry but its powers are limited.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can have serious social consequences and has been linked to crime and financial problems. The commission last year identified around 9,000 problem gamblers in Ireland out of a population of 4.7 million.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Accounts-For-One-Third-Of-Ireland’s-GDP"><a href="#Gambling-Accounts-For-One-Third-Of-Ireland’s-GDP" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Accounts For One-Third Of Ireland’s GDP"></a>Gambling Accounts For One-Third Of Ireland’s GDP</h1><p>It is well known that gambling is a major contributor to the Irish economy. In fact, gambling accounts for one-third of Ireland’s GDP. This is because the Irish are very passionate about gambling, and they love to gamble on anything and everything.</p>
<p>There are numerous gambling options available in Ireland, including online casinos, sports betting, poker, bingo, and lotteries. There are also many land-based casinos in Ireland, including ones in Dublin, Cork, and Limerick.</p>
<p>The Irish government has been very vocal about its support for the gambling industry. In fact, the Minister of State for Tourism and Sport stated that “the Irish gambling sector is a key contributor to the economy and provides substantial employment opportunities.” He also praised the industry for its “commitment to responsible gaming.”</p>
<p>The Irish government has been working hard to make the country a global hub for online gambling. In 2016, it launched a new licensing regime called Remote Gaming Licensing Ireland (RGLI). This regime allows online casino operators to obtain a license from Ireland and offer their services to players all over the world.</p>
<p>The Irish gambling industry is growing rapidly. In 2017, it generated €1.7 billion in revenue, which was a 9% increase from 2016. This growth is expected to continue in 2018 and beyond. The Irish government plans to invest heavily in the gambling industry in order to capitalize on this growth.</p>
<p>The Irish love their gambling, and it looks like this love affair is here to stay. Gambling accounts for one-third of Ireland’s GDP, and this figure is only going to grow larger in the years ahead.</p>
<h1 id="What-Do-Irish-Gamblers-Spend-Most-Time-On"><a href="#What-Do-Irish-Gamblers-Spend-Most-Time-On" class="headerlink" title="What Do Irish Gamblers Spend Most Time On?"></a>What Do Irish Gamblers Spend Most Time On?</h1><p>Online gambling is a huge industry and it’s no secret that Irish people love to gamble. In fact, Ireland has one of the highest rates of online gambling in the world. So what do Irish gamblers spend most of their time on?</p>
<p>There are a number of different types of gambling that Irish people enjoy, but the most popular by far is betting on sports. In fact, according to a study by Paddy Power, over 60% of Irish gamblers prefer to bet on sports. This could be because there are so many different options when it comes to betting on sports, from simple bets like who will win or lose, to more complicated bets like predicting how many points a team will score.</p>
<p>Another popular type of gambling in Ireland is playing casino games online. This could be because there are so many different types of casino games to choose from, each with its own set of rules and strategies. Casino games can be very exciting to play and can often be very rewarding, especially if you manage to win big.</p>
<p>Finally, another type of gambling that is popular in Ireland is online poker. Poker is a game that requires strategy and skill, and it can be very challenging and fun to play. There are also many different variations of poker available online, so you can always find a game that suits your level of experience and expertise.</p>
<h1 id="Betting-Firm-Reports-60-Increase-In-Irish-Gambling-In-2017"><a href="#Betting-Firm-Reports-60-Increase-In-Irish-Gambling-In-2017" class="headerlink" title="Betting Firm Reports 60% Increase In Irish Gambling In 2017"></a>Betting Firm Reports 60% Increase In Irish Gambling In 2017</h1><p>The gambling firm Paddy Power Betfair has released its yearly figures, announcing a 60% increase in Irish gambling since last year.</p>
<p>The report boasts that online gambling is up by 78%, with bets placed on sporting events and virtual games both seeing significant increases.</p>
<p>Commenting on the figures, a spokesperson for the company said that it was “pleased to see such growth inambling in Ireland” and that it looked forward to “continuing to provide our customers with a great experience”.</p>
<p>The news will no doubt be welcomed by the Irish government, which has been working hard to attract overseas investment in recent years. The country has seen something of a gambling boom in recent years, with industry experts attributing this to the relaxation of gambling laws in both Ireland and the UK.</p>
<p>This trend looks set to continue, with analysts predicting that the global online gambling market will reach a value of $81.7 billion by 2020. This is good news for Ireland, which is well-placed to capitalise on this growth given its close proximity to the UK market.</p>
<p>Gambling firms are now looking to expand into new markets, with South America and Asia seen as particularly attractive prospects.</p>
<h1 id="Ireland-Could-Make-5-Billion-From-Gambling-Industry"><a href="#Ireland-Could-Make-5-Billion-From-Gambling-Industry" class="headerlink" title="Ireland Could Make $5 Billion From Gambling Industry"></a>Ireland Could Make $5 Billion From Gambling Industry</h1><p>Ireland may soon have a thriving gambling industry. The country is considering regulating the sector in order to make up to €5 billion in revenue, reports the Irish Times.</p>
<p>While the government has not released an estimate of how much money could be raised from gambling, it’s clear that there is potential for a healthy return. The decision will hinge on what form of regulation is introduced, with different models offering different returns.</p>
<p>For example, if Ireland were to regulate and license online gambling it could generate approximately €318 million in revenue each year. Alternatively, if physical betting shops were allowed to open, this could bring in around €1.3 billion per year.</p>
<p>The Irish Gambling Industry has been growing rapidly in recent years and is now worth an estimated €2 billion annually. This growth is being driven by an increase in online gambling, which now accounts for over 60% of the market.</p>
<p>The proposed regulation would represent a significant change for Ireland’s gambling industry. Currently, it is largely unregulated with a number of unlicensed operators operating illegally. This has led to a number of problems including addiction and crime.</p>
<p>Introducing regulation would allow the government to better monitor and control the industry while also raising much needed revenue. It would also help protect consumers by ensuring that operators are licensed and meet safety standards.</p>
