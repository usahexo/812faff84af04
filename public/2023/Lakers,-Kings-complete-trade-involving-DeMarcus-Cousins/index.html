      Lakers, Kings complete trade involving DeMarcus Cousins

        <h1 id="Lakers-Kings-complete-trade-involving-DeMarcus-Cousins"><a href="#Lakers-Kings-complete-trade-involving-DeMarcus-Cousins" class="headerlink" title="Lakers, Kings complete trade involving DeMarcus Cousins"></a>Lakers, Kings complete trade involving DeMarcus Cousins</h1><p>The Lakers and Kings completed a trade Friday involving DeMarcus Cousins.</p>
<p>The Lakers send forward Ryan Kelly and center Robert Sacre to the Kings in exchange for Cousins.</p>
<p>“We are excited to add DeMarcus Cousins to our roster,” said Lakers General Manager Mitch Kupchak. “He is an extremely talented big man who will be a force in the middle for us. We thank Ryan Kelly and Robert Sacre for their contributions to the Lakers and wish them the best in Sacramento.”</p>
<p>Cousins, 25, has appeared in 440 games (439 starts) over six seasons with the Kings, averaging 21.5 points, 10.7 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 1.4 blocks per game. He was named an NBA All-Star in 2015 and 2016.</p>
<h1 id="Boston-Celtics-acquiring-Kyrie-Irving-from-Cleveland-Cavaliers"><a href="#Boston-Celtics-acquiring-Kyrie-Irving-from-Cleveland-Cavaliers" class="headerlink" title="Boston Celtics acquiring Kyrie Irving from Cleveland Cavaliers"></a>Boston Celtics acquiring Kyrie Irving from Cleveland Cavaliers</h1><p>On Tuesday, the Boston Celtics acquired Kyrie Irving from the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Ante Zizic and the Brooklyn Nets’ 2018 first-round draft pick.</p>
<p>This blockbuster deal marks the end of an era in Cleveland and sets up Kyrie Irving for a fresh start in Boston.</p>
<p>The trade also raises some questions about the Celtics’ future. After reaching the Eastern Conference Finals last season, they are now without their two best players: Isaiah Thomas and Gordon Hayward, who signed with the team in free agency this summer.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this trade makes the Celtics a much better team and significantly improves their chances of making it to the NBA Finals. Kyrie Irving is a supremely talented player who is coming off his best season yet. He averaged 25.2 points per game and shot 47% from the field last year. With Kyrie Irving on board, the Celtics will be one of the favorites to win the East.</p>
<p>Isaiah Thomas was an important part of last year’s Celtics team, but he is not nearly as good as Kyrie Irving. Jae Crowder is also a good player, but he is not worth Kyrie Irving. Ante Zizic is a rookie who has yet to play in an NBA game, so he is not really worth anything either.</p>
<p>The Brooklyn Nets’ 2018 first-round draft pick is also interesting. It could potentially be one of the top picks in next year’s draft, which would make it very valuable. The Celtics now have two first-round picks next year (along with their own pick), which gives them a lot of flexibility to make more moves or build for the future.</p>
<h1 id="Oklahoma-City-Thunder-Acquire-Paul-George-From-Indiana-Pacers"><a href="#Oklahoma-City-Thunder-Acquire-Paul-George-From-Indiana-Pacers" class="headerlink" title="Oklahoma City Thunder Acquire Paul George From Indiana Pacers"></a>Oklahoma City Thunder Acquire Paul George From Indiana Pacers</h1><p>The Oklahoma City Thunder have acquired Paul George from the Indiana Pacers in exchange for Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis.</p>
<p>George is a four-time All-Star who averaged 23.7 points and 6.6 rebounds last season. The 27-year-old is entering the final year of his contract and is expected to become a free agent next summer.</p>
<p>Oladipo was the No. 2 overall pick in the 2013 draft and averaged 15.9 points last season. Sabonis was the No. 11 overall pick in the 2016 draft and averaged 5.9 points and 3.8 rebounds last season as a rookie.</p>
<h1 id="Houston-Rockets-Land-All-Star-Forward-Carmelo-Anthony-In-Trade-With-New-York-Knicks"><a href="#Houston-Rockets-Land-All-Star-Forward-Carmelo-Anthony-In-Trade-With-New-York-Knicks" class="headerlink" title="Houston Rockets Land All-Star Forward Carmelo Anthony In Trade With New York Knicks"></a>Houston Rockets Land All-Star Forward Carmelo Anthony In Trade With New York Knicks</h1><p>Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey announced today that the team has acquired All-Star forward Carmelo Anthony from the New York Knicks in exchange for guard Eric Gordon, forward Trevor Ariza, center Alex Len and a protected first round pick in 2021.</p>
<p>“We are excited to welcome Carmelo to the Rockets organization,” said Morey. “He is a 10-time All-Star and one of the best offensive players in the league. We think he will be a great fit with Chris Paul and James Harden and will make us a better basketball team.”</p>
<p>The move reunites Anthony with head coach Mike D’Antoni, who coached him during his most successful seasons in New York.</p>
<p>“I’m happy to be here,” said Anthony. “Houston is a great city and I look forward to being part of the Rockets organization and helping them win a championship.”</p>
<p>This is a blockbuster trade that shakes up the entire NBA landscape. Let’s take a closer look at what each team is getting:</p>
<p>Houston Rockets Get: Carmelo Anthony<br>New York Knicks Get: Eric Gordon, Trevor Ariza, Alex Len, 2021 first round pick</p>
<h1 id="Philadelphia-76ers-Complete-Blockbuster-Trade-For-Star-Center-Joel-Embiid"><a href="#Philadelphia-76ers-Complete-Blockbuster-Trade-For-Star-Center-Joel-Embiid" class="headerlink" title="Philadelphia 76ers Complete Blockbuster Trade For Star Center Joel Embiid"></a>Philadelphia 76ers Complete Blockbuster Trade For Star Center Joel Embiid</h1><p>On July 8, the Philadelphia 76ers completed a blockbuster trade for star center Joel Embiid. In exchange for the third overall pick in the 2014 NBA Draft, the Sixers sent Nerlens Noel and a future first-round draft pick to the Boston Celtics.</p>
<p>The addition of Embiid gives Philadelphia one of the most talented young cores in the league. The 7’0” Cameroonian is a physical specimen with a monstrous 7’5” wingspan and tremendous agility for his size. He also possesses an extremely polished offensive game for a player his age, averaging 20.2 points and 7.8 rebounds per game on 62 percent shooting last season in just 25 minutes per game.</p>
<p>Defensively, Embiid has already shown himself to be a dominant force, blocking 2.6 shots per game and ranking fourth in the NCAA in blocked shots percentage as a freshman at Kansas. His length, size, and instincts make him an ideal fit as a center in today’s NBA, where slow-footed big men are becoming extinct.</p>
<p>However, his health is certainly a question mark after he missed his entire rookie season with a stress fracture in his right foot. The Sixers believe that Embiid’s injury was caused by years of playing soccer and volleyball on cement courts in Africa without shoes, and they are confident that he can manage it with better footwear moving forward.</p>
<p>Noel was Philadelphia’s first-round pick in 2013 but never quite fit into head coach Brett Brown’s plans. The 6’11” Noel is an elite shot blocker but is still very raw offensively and lacks Embiid’s polished scoring touch. He also averaged only 10.5 points and 8.1 rebounds per game last season while shooting just 47 percent from the field.</p>
<p>Boston drafted Celtics point guard Marcus Smart with the sixth overall pick in this year’s draft as part of this trade package and will likely start him alongside Isaiah Thomas in the backcourt next season.</p>
